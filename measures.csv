Building on the work of Slow Streets, traffic management solutions are to be found with the aim to acquire a measurable change in modal shift in that particular locality. Slower speeds, road infrastructure changes to accommodate cycling, walking and use of e-scooters, and collective transport are some of the solutions to be considered. This pilot project is to be accompanied by a study on the impact on business and residents in the area. ERA is to make efforts to increase air monitoring in the area to gauge any improvement. The results of this pilot project is to feed into future measures to be considered in the longer term such as the introduction of controlled parking for residents, starting with high-traffic areas and areas with high parking demand.  The rationale behind this measure would not be revenue generation but to start reclaiming public space from parking uses to other uses that support active and green mobility.

This would apply for students living in close proximity to the school. Depending on the outcome of the exercise and location of school, this exercise would feed into the possible extension of a nationwide project. It is important for safe routes to be implemented for school students to get from home to school and back on foot or cycling. This will also encourage children to understand the benefits of active travel from a young age.Consider extending free school transport indefinitely and study the reasons why parents are reluctant to make use of the service with a view to increase uptake year-on-year.

6,empty,All,A greener public and private vehicle fleet ,empty,Improve financial grants for more efficient internal combustion engines,"This proposal is oriented towards reducing the average age of Malta’s fleet in the short to medium term, until a higher percentage of charging infrastructure and closer price parity for EVs are achieved. Two options are being presented for private cars: (a) Increase scrappage schemes for ICE vehicles for the whole of the Maltese Islands:  To ensure a higher uptake of cleaner vehicles, it is being proposed that financial grants for cleaner ICE vehicles when scrapping an existing vehicle are increased. Such a measure will eventually lead to a rejuvenation of the age of the fleet whereby more efficient technology of the newer vehicles will lead to a reduction in emissions. It is proposed that the grant is also awarded to individuals who decide not to purchase a new vehicle and therefore renounce their driving license. This grant could be introduced based on the Euro Classification of vehicles scrapped: the lower the Euro Standard of vehicle being scrapped, the higher the grant. If for example, a vehicle owner decides to scrap a Euro 2 vehicle, the grant would be greater than if a Euro 5 vehicle is being scrapped. (b) Extend the current Gozo scheme for the inner harbour area. NSO statistics show that the older fleet is owned by residents in the Southern Harbour (15.6 years in 2019, NSO). It is being proposed that the recent Budget 2022 scheme for Gozo (15.1 years in 2019, NSO) is extended to the inner harbour area, possibly only for the cleanest and smaller ICE vehicles. Both options above are short-term measures and should be reviewed annually.","Stakeholders'meeting feedback from ERA/BM 270, 271",Medium-term  2024 for the inner harbour area  2025/2026 extended for all of Malta ,empty,National ,Government,empty
